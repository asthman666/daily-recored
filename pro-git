1) Checking the Status of Your Files

git status

2) Skipping the Staging Area

use '-a' option to the 'git commit' command makes Git automatically stage every file that is already tracked before doing the commit, letting you skip the git add part

3) Removing Files

git rm file

If you modified the file and added it to the index already, you must force the removal with the '-f' option

git rm --cached file, you may want to keep the file on your hard drive but not have Git track it anymore

4) Moving Files

git mv file_from file_to

mv file_from file_to && git rm file_from && git add file_to
